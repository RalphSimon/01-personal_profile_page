          <h2 class="subheading">Background</h2>
          <p>Five years ago I moved to Antwerp, pursuing a degree in Theatre. As much I was drawn to the performative arts, I couldn't keep my eye from the web. It's like a stage production where content writers, designers and developers make beautiful experiences for their viewers, or better yet: "users". Digging a bit deeper into web design and development, I noticed at what high pace the industry and its community were evolving.</p>

          <p>Coming from a background that couldn't be further away from web development, I've embraced deisgning and developping for the web whole heartedly. Leaving the theatre behind (for now), I've enrolled into TreeHouse courses for the past two years. Since then, a whole world of possibilities has opened up to me and has kept me excited ever since.</p>

          <p>But keeping up with the high pace of the industry is no small feat. That has resulted in a slew of pet projects, a lot of reading and following courses. But up till now I never had the courage to share what I'm doing with the world. Enter the TreeHouse Techdegree.</p>

          <blockquote cite="https://teamtreehouse.com/about">
            <p>Treehouse believes in the democratization of technical education. There are currently too many barriers, economical and psychological. Our students learn at their own pace and become job ready within months at a fraction of the cost.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>With this curriculum, TreeHouse enables me to build up a decent portfolio and help me develop my skills in a more focused way. The page(s) you're looking at are the first step, and who knows the first steps venturing into an enticing career in the web dev industry!</p>

          <h2 class="subheading">Reaching out</h2>
          <p>Next to developing my skills I'd like this first project to be living a document directed at potential employers, off-course to impress them. But maybe even more important I want this project and the projects that follow to be my way of <a href="http://www.payitforwardfoundation.org/">paying it forward</a>. Everything I've learned up till now wouldn't have been possible without the effort, skills and knowledge of the great Open Source communities at large. So hopefully I can provide anybody embarking on a similar digital adventure like I am with a boost for their journey.</p>

          <p class="caption">For some great insight into what the concept of Open Source could mean, not just for digital natives, but for everything outside of the web & software development industry as well, take a look at the work of <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens" class="">Michel Bauwens</a> and the <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/">Peer 2 Peer foundation</a></p>
